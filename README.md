This app provides a home screen seconds clock widget for Android.

To configure the widget, just run the app. The widget can be configured to display any combination of the following:-

1. the time in 12-or 24-hour format in accordance with the device's preference, with or without seconds,

2. the day of the week in short or long locale-appropriate format.

3. the date in numeric locale-appropriate format, or any combination of the following:-

    1. the day of the month,
    2. the month name in short or long locale-appropraite format,
    3. the (Gregorian) year number

The time, day of the week, and long date will all fit into a 1x1 widget with a fairly small text size, but if you display less information or make the widget bigger, it will reformat itself so as to make more effective use of the available space and use a larger text size.

You can also configure the text colour of the widget's text and the colour and transparency of the widget's background. The default of white text on a transparent background works well unless you have a very light or very complex wallpaper on your home screen.

Displaying the seconds will increase battery drain because the widget has to update itself every second, but it doesn't update when it isn't visible.

This is version 0.1 which isn't quite ready for prime time yet, but it works so I'm posting the source because it answers a question asked on StackOverflow. In due course I plan to provide a release with a built APK.

It works on Android 8.0 API 26 or later.
