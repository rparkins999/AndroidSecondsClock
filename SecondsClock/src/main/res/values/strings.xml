        If there is currently no home screen widget, the size may not be correct
        because SecondsClock can\'t find out what size the widget would be:
        it will use an estimate for the size of a 1x1 widget.
        If you resize the widget on the home screen to a larger size,
        the widget will rearrange its layout to use a larger font size.
